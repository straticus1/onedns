onedns debug <options>
onedns mkpacket <dns-packet> <value>
onedns makekey
onedns txt <host> validate
onedns spf make <host>
onedns spf get <host>
onedns dmarc get or show <host>
onedns appliance set <ibx|bluecat> <url> <key<
onedns validate <type> <platform>
onedns science <dnsscience> <platform> <features> <host or url>

platform = ibx,bluecat,djbdns,bind,powerdns,unbound,nsd
validate supports type = <dir> or <file>
